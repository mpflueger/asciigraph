---AsciiGraph---
Author: Max Pflueger (mpflueger at gmail)

asciiGraph is program designed to provide graphing functions displayed via
ascii-art on the command line.  Due to the limitations of ascii text it will
never produce graphs as precise or pretty as a program such as Matlab or 
Mathematica, and it should not be considered a replacement for such programs.
Rather, this is for all those times when you have some data in a file, or 
coming out of a program and you just need to get a quick feel for it.  This
is particularly useful if the data is on a remote machine you are connected
to via SSH.

*Initial Version
  Right now asciiGraph will only draw vertical bar graphs based on a column
  of data on standard input (STDIN).  The height and width of the graph can be 
  adjusted, and the bars will scale automatically to fit the range of the data 
  into the dimensions of the graph.  The width of the bars will also be adjusted 
  according to how many data points there are.
  
  --TODO--
  +Option to draw bars horizontally
  +Option to scale graph to terminal window size
  +Ability to do a generate a histogram from input points
  +Line graph
  +Scatter plot
  +Superimpose two data sets with different fill characters
  +Add capability to do colored text
